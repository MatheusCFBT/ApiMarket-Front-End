This is the front-end of the **ApiMarket** project, a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Angular and Bootstrap, designed to connect developers and consumers of APIs.

## Overview

## Technologies Used

- **Bootstrap:** For responsive design and UI components.
- **TypeScript:** Programming language used for development.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the pages.
- **REST API:** Communication with the [ApiMarket Back-End](https://github.com/MatheusCFBT/ApiMarket).
